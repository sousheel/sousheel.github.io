      <!-- <h3>There is no date to this because I've had philosophical ramblings in my head ever since I was born... #woke</h3> -->
      <p>
        Forgive me for sounding absolutely stupid and crazy, these are only ideas that I must organize sometime.
        Counter arguments also need to be thought of.

        #1 July 20, 2017: Everything we know is created by synthesis.
        This meay mean synthesizing words to create new meaning (sentences)
        or synthesizing a horn and a horse to get a unicorn. Because of this, I believe all knowledge is heirarchical.
        We must synthesize lower level ideas together in order to get to the next level of knowledge.

        #2 July 20, 2017: Inference is impossible, because it is impossible to know the state of everything in the world.
        Therefore, all the inferences we make can be compromised. I believe this makes the world rely on probability.
