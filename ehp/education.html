      <h1>Education</h1>

      <h3>Philosophy of Education: </h3>
      <p>
        Education results in a higher state of mind which allows one to take on life's
        challenges. Conditions are always changing and it is impossible to adapt without learning.
        Whether that education is formal or not, it provides us with information needed
        to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe many concepts are universal, so when I am learning something, I always try to
        apply that knowledge to another field. It's amazing that some of the knowledge I gained from
        going to the gym can apply to how I study (building discipline and tracking progress).
      </p>
      <p>
        One should be learning all the time. When you apply that learning,
        you can reevaluate that application and learn more
        by educating yourself. It's a constant cycle of learning then applying knowledge.
      </p>
